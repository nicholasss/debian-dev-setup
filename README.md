# Debian Server Setup

These scripts are meant to install packages and tools that I tend to use.
Do not use unless you have read the entire script and want the same packages!

## packaged tools

- btop: configurable resource monitor
- curl: general purpose network transfer tool
- fd-find (fd): friendly alternative to 'find'
- fzf (fuzzyfinder): general purpose command-line fuzzyfinder
- git: source/version control tool
- jq: command-line json processor
- nano: a tiny and friendly GNU text editor
- ripgrep (rg): searches current directory with regex while respecting .gitignore
- tmux: terminal multiplexer

## aliases

- ll --> ls -lha
- rm --> rm -i

## downloaded tools

- neovim: modern lua-configurable terminal text editor
- lazyvim: neovim distribution that I like the most
- webi: easy tool to manage development environment
- envman (from webi): automatically adds items to the $PATH
- lazygit: nice porcelain git tool, used in lazyvim

## home directories
